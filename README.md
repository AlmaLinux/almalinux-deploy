# almalinux-deploy

An EL to AlmaLinux migration tool.


## Usage

In order to convert your EL8 operating system to AlmaLinux do the following:

1. Make a backup of the system. We didn't test all possible scenarios so there
   is a risk that something goes wrong. In such a situation you will have a
   restore point.
2. Download the [almalinux-deploy.sh](almalinux-deploy.sh) script:
   ```shell
   $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux-deploy/master/almalinux-deploy.sh
   ```
3. Run the script and check its output for errors:
   ```shell
   $ sudo bash almalinux-deploy.sh
     ...
     Migration to AlmaLinux is completed
   ```
4. Ensure that your system was successfully converted:
   ```shell
   # check release file
   $ cat /etc/redhat-release 
   AlmaLinux release 8.4 (Electric Cheetah)
   
   # check that the system boots AlmaLinux kernel by default
   $ sudo grubby --info DEFAULT | grep AlmaLinux
   title="AlmaLinux (4.18.0-305.el8.x86_64) 8.4"
   ```
5. Thank you for choosing AlmaLinux!

* Functional tests are implemented using
  [Molecule](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule),
  [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) and
  [Testinfra](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-testinfra). Virtual machines
  are powered by [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and
  [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

To run the functional tests do the following:

1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox.
